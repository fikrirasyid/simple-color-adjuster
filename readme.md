# Simple Color Adjuster

Simple class to do Sass' `lighten()` and `darken()` using PHP
Intentionally made for WordPress theming. [SCSS PHP](http://leafo.net/scssphp/) is amazing but it triggers too much alert on theme-check. Hence a need for a simpler one.
This library is originally made for [Materialist theme](http://fikrirasy.id/portfolio/materialist).
